  "instructions": "It should take no time to whip up a bunch of these fluffy, tender biscuits which are great with chicken but could also be served for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Biscuits: 2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon baking powder 1 teaspoon sea salt 1 teaspoon granulated sugar 1 stick (4 ounces) unsalted butter, frozen 1 cup cold buttermilk 1 large egg, beaten Honey butter: 1 stick (4 ounces) unsalted butter, softened 1/4 cup honey 1/4 teaspoon sea salt Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a rimmed quarter-baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat. To prepare biscuits: To a large bowl, add the flour, baking powder, and salt; whisk to combine. Using the largest holes on a cheese grater, grate the frozen butter into the flour and mix with a fork to coat the butter with the flour. Make a well in the center and add the buttermilk; use the fork to mix just until the mixture forms large clumps and starts to come together. Turn the biscuit dough onto a lightly floured surface and roll into a 1—inch—thick rectangle. Using a 4—inch round biscuit cutter, cut out 8 rounds and transfer them to prepared baking sheet. Brush with beaten egg and transfer the biscuits to the oven. Bake until golden-brown and cooked through, 12 to 14 minutes. Transfer the biscuits to a rack and let cool for at least 5 minutes. To prepare honey butter: In a small bowl, stir together the softened butter, honey, and salt using a fork. Set aside. To serve: Transfer biscuits to a large warmed platter and serve immediately with honey butter. “\\ . , , "
